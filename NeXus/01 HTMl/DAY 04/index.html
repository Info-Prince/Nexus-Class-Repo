<!--? In html we're using UTF-8 conversion why ? 

Since server will return response in binary form , if we'll use ASCII conversion then it'll take 1 byte of memory , which can uniquely identify only 256 no. of chars ( but in actual it was uniquely identifying only 128 chars )..... However UTF-8 can allocate memory upto (1,2,3,4) byte.

-> eng chars (ASCII) - will be represented by 1 byte.
-> latin lan chars - will be represented by 2 byte.
-> hindi / chinise lan chars - will be represented by 3 byte.
-> emojis -> will be represented by 4 byte. -->


<!--? How to determine that which is coming in response from the server . Like is it eng, hin, latin, emojis ? -->
<!--? For eg data will come as : - 32 bit, 16 bit , 32 dib... So here how we can determine that which type of data is it ? -->

<!-- Ans will be find out in the same file of image. -->




<!--? How image will store in system ? -->

<!-- Pixel has been defined in the form of rows and column, And these rows and column will form numerous of boxes ( each box = 1 pixel ). Each box called pixel.... And all these box will store different different color combination so that image can be formed.... 

Since each box will store diff diff color combination of ( RGB ) with it's required portion ( each color range from 0 - 255). So this way, a box (1px) will take max size of 24 bit (3 byte) of memory for storing a color. ( each color red, green, blue will take 8 bit of memory ).

For eg:- we have 100 row and 100 col , so it can form 100*100 = 10000 boxes (pixel). And each pixel will take 3 byte of memory , So image will be stored in 10000*3 size of memory. which will be almost 30kb. -->


<!--? why some img have low quality and some have very high quality ? -->

<!-- Ex:- If we give 8 bit to represent each color (red, green, blue) and this way we can represent pow(2,24) diff diff color.
And on the other hand we're giving 10 bit to represent each color and this way we can represent pow(2,30) diff diff color.
And on the very diff situation we're giving 16 bit to represent each color and this way we can represent pow(2,48) diff diff color.

On 1st eg image quality will be low, but on the 2nd image it's quality will be improved but on the very last eg image clarity will be highest.... -->
