<!-- ? Why sometimes image don't visible on browser however path is correct ? -->
<!-- img isn't showing however correct address... It's only because some website don't give access to all, website owner wale users ko img use krne se block kiye huee rhte hai, so that bandwidth cost increase na ho -->


<!-- ? relative Vs. absolute address -->
<!-- relative address-> referred address for the only person who is asking to reach to that specific location
eg-> someone ask to reach to iskon from patna junction.
eg-> ./img.png 

absolute address -> Exact address for all users
eg-> someone ask to go to iskon of patna, location :- india->bihar->patna->near patna junction
eg-> Exact location of any file, ( D:\OneDrive\Desktop ) -->

<!-- ? How to define path of any file or image ? -->
 <!-- Follow right way to access file

./image.png -> it'll take you to the currect folder, since it can be achieved without using ./ like ( image.png )
./ -> it will take you on the top of current folder only
../ -> this will take you on the top of current folder -->


<!-- ? Why vs code or any code editor don't allow absolute path access ? -->
 <!-- For window C drive is root folder...
The Folder which you will open in vs code that will work as a root directory for server ( Server are present in VS code ) , And vs code can access data upto that particular directory only.

Due to privacy reason VS code can't get access of root directory. Since root directory se system ke sare data ko access kiya ja skta hai...

Here Vs code is client and inside of it there's internal server which can be assumed as actual server.
VS code (client) will through request to server where our file is being hosted ( which is reserved ip address ) on a particular host, And in this way since server have access to this currently opened file. And it'll return html, css and javaScript to client in response.-->
